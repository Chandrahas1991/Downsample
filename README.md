# Downsample
A multithreaded program to downsample 2D boost arrays.

This is a program that let's a user create a 2D array of size dimA X dimB where dimA and dimB are powers of  2. 
The program then prints all the downsampled verison's of the 2D array where the dimensions of the array reduce by 2^l where l = {1....min(dimA, dimb)}
